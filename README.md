# Basics of Hardware Cache Optimization

A seminar paper about hardware caches and how to use them effectively.  You can download
the **[paper here][pdf]** and view slides created with [org-reveal] for an accompanying
presentation **[here][slides]**.

## Abstract

Typical present-day CPUs have two or more levels of caches. This article provides basic
insight into their operation and presents key architectural properties which suggest
possible program optimizations.  The abstract external memory model (EMM) for memory
hierarchies and the cache-oblivious model (COM) derived from it are presented briefly.
