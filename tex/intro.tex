\section{Introduction}
% What is this paper about?  Why learn about them?  How much performance is at stake?

% What are hardware caches?  Why caches?
A hardware cache is a \alts{comparatively, relatively} fast and small physical memory.  It
stores a subset of the data present in slower, larger \alts{storage, memory} that is
expected to be used again soon.  The purpose of this additional memory is to reduce the
number of accesses to the underlying slower storage.

% Hardware caches aren't going away.
There are fundamental reasons that having one single, \alts{uniform, homogeneous} type of
memory is not viable.  No signal can propagate faster than the speed of light.  Thus,
every storage technology can only reach a finite amount of data within a desired access
latency~\cite[2]{afmh}.

The most ubiquitous example for hardware caches \alts{is the hierarchy, are the various
levels (most commonly 2 or 3)} of CPU caches that are found on almost all present-day
CPUs.  They are designated \gls{l1} cache, \gls{l2} cache, and so on, with \gls{l1} being
the fastest and smallest level.  The underlying storage for CPU caches is the main memory.

There are more storage levels that \alts{comprise, constitute} the \emph{memory hierarchy}
of a computer along with CPU caches and main memory.  For example \glspl{hdd} and
\glspl{ssd}.
% Also: registers, internal buffers of HDDs and SSDs, (tapes), ...
% Focus on CPU caches.  Why?
However, swapping to \glspl{hdd} and \glspl{ssd} continues to become somewhat less common
as main memory sizes increase.  Even non-server systems can currently support 64 GiB of
main memory, eliminating the need for swapping to disk under many workloads.

I will focus on how to use CPU caches effectively and the \alts{enabled, resulting}
performance gains in this \article{}.
