% Mathematical analysis of algorithms to obtain asymptotic upper bounds is nice.  Ignoring
% the non-uniform nature of memory hierarchies can yield pretty bad results, though.  What
% can be done about this?

We have seen that
\alts{
  {the hidden constant \alts{separating, distinguishing} the time complexities of two
  reasonable algorithms under asymptotic analysis can get quite big in the presence of a
  memory hierarchy.},
  {analyzing \alts{an algorithm's,} \alts{time, asymptotic, algorithmic} complexity,
  % This is not true: it doesn't matter for asymptotic complexity if there are different
  % types of memory.
  \x{under the usual \gls{ram} model, where a single uniform memory is \alts{presumed,
  assumed, supposed, premised},}
  can be quite inaccurate in the presence of a memory hierarchy.},
}
\alts{
  To \alts{escape, avert, prevent} having to rely \alts{only, entirely, exclusively} on
  empirical results, To overcome this problem,
},
abstract machine models taking the non-uniform \alts{memories of, nature of memory in}
real-world computers into account \alts{can be used, are used, have been proposed}.
% By whom?
One of these is the \emph{\gls{emm}}\x{\alts{
  ~\cite[5]{afmh},
  {, used \alts{in~\cite{afmh}, by \textcite{afmh}}.},
}}.
