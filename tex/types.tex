Current x86 CPUs \alts{generally, typically, commonly} have three main types of caches:
data caches, instruction caches, and \glspl{tlb}%
~\cite[\href{https://youtu.be/WDIkqP4JbkE?t=11m07s}{11:07}]{scott-meyers-talk}.
Some caches are used for data as well as instructions and are called \emph{unified}.%
~\cite[20]{drepper2007}.
\alts{{A processor may have multiple caches of each type, which}, {Multiple caches of each
type may be present, and}} are organised into numerical \emph{levels}
\alts{{starting at 1, the smallest and fastest level,},}
based on their size and speed.
% Each added level is bigger and slower than its predecessor.
% The smallest and fastest is level 1.

% TODO?  The reason to have multiple levels...

% > Systems nowaeays have at-least two levels of cache
%      -- Algorithms for Memory Hierarchies, page 172
% > [T]he caches from L2 on are unified caches which contain both code and data

The biggest target for optimizations is the data cache.  \say{[Instruction] cache is much
less problematic}~\cite[31]{drepper2007} and optimizations for data and instruction cache
tend to improve \gls{tlb} usage as well%

My laptop's AMD E-450 CPU has cores with \alts{an \gls{l1d} cache of 32 KiB, 32 KiB of
\gls{l1d} cache} and a unified \gls{l2} cache of 512 KiB each.%
\footnote{\Cref{app:cpuinfo} explains how to obtain this information.}
We can both verify these sizes and get \alts{a reasonably good measure, a rough measure,
an approximation} of the access times by profiling
\cref{lst:access-times}
% the \alts{program, listing} below
for different values of \mintinline{text}{SIZE}.%
% FIXME: the label is wrong: should be "Appendix" but is "Section".
\footnote{\Cref{app:cycles} details how.}
% It reads random memory addresses
% The program randomly reads
% locations
% The program repeatedly \alts{reads, accesses} random elements
This program repeatedly \alts{reads, accesses} elements
from \alts[2]{an array of the configured size, a thusly sized array}
in random \alts{order, sequence, succession}.
To do this
\alts{with minimal overhead, efficiently}, the array \alts{is first set up, acts} as a
circular, singly linked list where every element except the last \alts{points to a, has a}
random successor.  When compiled with \mintinline{text}{-DBASELINE}, only this
initialization is done.

\begin{comment}
   We will see why this measurement was conducted with random instead of sequential
   accesses in \cref{sec:prefetch}.

   \Cref{sec:prefetch} \alts{explains, will explain} the reason for \x{going through the
   trouble of} \alts{using, conducting} random accesses instead of just reading the array
   sequentially\x{for this measurement}.
\end{comment}
\alts{We use random accesses because,
      The reason for using random accesses is that}
the CPU will detect and optimize sequential access by a technique called
\emph{prefetching} discussed in \cref{sec:prefetch}, which would prevent us from
\alts{determining, assessing} access times.

% \Cref{fig:access-times} shows the \alts{difference, deltas} of CPU cycles used when and
% when not having defined \mintinline{text}{BASELINE}.
\Cref{fig:access-times} shows the extra CPU cycles used by \cref{lst:access-times}
\alts{in addition to, above, compared to, relative to} the \mintinline{text}{BASELINE}
version for different array sizes.
That is, only the cycles used by the main loop are \alts{given, counted}, not those for
initialization.  I divided by \mintinline{text}{N} to get the cycles spent \alts{per, on
each} loop iteration.

Up to 32 KiB, each access takes almost exactly 3 cycles.%
\footnote{The numerical results are shown in \vref{tab:access-times}.}
This is the \gls{l1d} access \alts{time, latency}.  At 32 KiB (the size of the \gls{l1d})
the time increases to about 3.4 cycles.  This is not surprising since the cache is shared
with other processes and the operating system, so some of our data gets \emph{evicted}.
The first dramatic increase happens at 64 KiB followed by smaller increases at 128 and 256
KiB.  I suspect we are seeing a mixture of \gls{l2} and \gls{l1d} accesses, with less and
less \gls{l1d} \emph{hits} and an \gls{l2} access time \x{of} around 25 cycles.

The values from 512 KiB (the size of the \gls{l2}) to 128 MiB \alts{exhibit, follow} a
similar pattern.  The relative increase when the array size matches that of the \gls{l2}
is \alts{greater, more striking} than for the \gls{l1d} before; possibly because \gls{l2}
is a unified cache that also holds instructions.  Eventually, more and more accesses go to
main memory, \alts{causing, incurring} delays of up to 200
cycles~\cite[cf.][\pno~17, figure 3.4]{drepper2007}.

% FOLDOC has an entry on 'working set'.
\alts[2]{{Evidently,}, The data suggests that} keeping the \emph{working set} a process
uses during a time interval small can yield dramatic performance improvements.
