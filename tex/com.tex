The \emph{\gls{com}} or \emph{ideal-cache model}, introduced by
\textcite{coa-for-publication}, \alts{concedes, leaves, forfeits} most of the
aforementioned problems to empirical evaluation and further increases the level of
abstraction.
%
Algorithms for the \gls{com}, called \emph{cache-oblivious algorithms}, are designed
without the \alts{
  cache size \(M\) or block size \(B\),
  values of \(M\) and \(B\),
}
as parameters.  This seems silly since these values typically can be queried easily
\x{automatically} at both run and compile time~\cite[50]{drepper2007}
% See <https://stackoverflow.com/a/7284876>.  Also, cache line sizes are super homogeneous
% anyway.
but, perhaps counterintuitively, models one aspect of memory hierarchies better than the
\gls{emm}.

An algorithm that performs well in the \gls{com} performs well across the entire memory
hierarchy~\cites[194\psq]{afmh}[4]{erikcom}; the same argument \alts[2]{\alts{for,
showing} asymptotically optimal movement of data, for data movement being
\x{asymptotically} \emph{optimal}} applies between any two levels of memory%
~\cite[lemma 15, \pno~10]{coa-paper}.
% TODO.  Is asymptotic analysis even useful, though?  The whole point of these models is
% that the hidden constants of "standard" asymptotic analysis matter.

% What does "optimal" mean?

%      -- http://supertech.csail.mit.edu/papers/FrigoLePr99.pdf#page=2, footnote
Optimal means that the asymptotic~\cite[2]{coa-paper} number of cache misses incurred
\x{by a cache-oblivious algorithm} matches the problem's lower bound in the \gls{com}.

% > In contrast to the external-memory model, algorithms in the cache-oblivious model

%      -- http://erikdemaine.org/papers/BRICS2002/paper.pdf (erikcom), page 5
Cache misses take the place of \acrshortpl{io} \x{used in the \gls{emm}} because
cache-oblivious algorithms don't \alts{manage the cache, read or write cache lines}
explicitly.  This wouldn't be possible since the algorithms know neither the cache nor
the cache line size~\cite[5]{erikcom}.
% > The ideal cache uses the optimal off-line strategy of replacing the cache line whose
% > next access is furthest in the future
%      -- http://supertech.csail.mit.edu/papers/FrigoLePr99.pdf#page=1
Instead, the \gls{com} uses the optimal replacement strategy of evicting the cache line
that won't be accessed for the longest time in the future (Bélády's Algorithm).  This
\alts{
  is strangely \alts{at odds, out of touch, unrealistic} with real-world caches that don't
  know the future,
  {seems like out-of-touch, theoretical ivory-tower nonsense},
}.

However, \citeauthor{coa-thesis} proves that for many algorithms\footnote{%
   Those satisfying equation (7.1) in~\cite[46]{coa-thesis}.  If the number of cache
   misses incurred by the algorithm only \say{depends polynomially on the cache size
   \(M\)}, the \alts{equation, condition} is satisfied~\cite[6]{erikcom}.
   % Halving the cache size only increases the number of cache misses by a constant
   % factor?
}
it only increases cache misses by a constant factor compared to various feasible
replacement strategies%

\citeauthor{coa-thesis} further justifies the model by proving, \say{with only minor
assumptions}~\cite[12]{coa-thesis}, that cache-oblivious algorithms that are optimal in
the \gls{com} \alts{can by executed with an optimal amount of \acrshortpl{io}, are also
optimal} in the \gls{emm}~\cite[theorem 32, \pno~56]{coa-thesis}.  In other words, most
cache-oblivious algorithms can be systematically transformed into \alts{cache-aware,
\gls{emm}} algorithms that asymptotically require the same amount of memory transfers in
the \gls{emm} as the cache-oblivious variant in the \gls{com}.

% TODO: given our motivation that "constant factors matter", what have we been doing here?

% TODO.  A regular algorithm that isn't explicitly for a hierarchical memory model
% (doesn't explicitly move data between different levels of memory) is already
% cache-oblivious, right?

% Time to give an example algorithm.  Options:
% *  matrix transposition
% *  matrix multiplication
% *  searching a tree (Van Emde Boas layout vs. standard layout)
% *  sorting
%    *  not easy
%    *  good performance seems problematic
%    *  looks like the autors of [1] dit it, though (lazy funnelsort)
% *  something about linked lists?
%
% Maybe matrix transposition...

\subsubsection{Cache-Oblivious Matrix Transposition}

The straightforward way to transpose \alts{
   an \(m\times n\) matrix \(D\),
   a matrix \(D\in\mathbb{R}^{m\times{}n}\),
}
out-of-place is to use two loops like so:
\begin{minted}[autogobble]{c}
   for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i)
      for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j)
         E[j][i] = D[i][j];
\end{minted}
Assuming \(D\) and \(E\) are stored in row-major layout (as they would be in the C and
\cpp{} languages), the reads from \(D\) are sequential memory accesses but the writes to
\(E\) are not.

\alts{When \(D^\mathsf{T}\) has, For} sufficiently long rows (\(m > B\))\footnote{%
   \(D^\mathsf{T}\) will be an \(n\times m\) matrix, so \(m\) is its number of columns.
},
every consecutive access will be to a different cache line.  If it has sufficiently many
rows,
\alts{{%
      the constant amount of lines that are still kept in cache by the optimal replacement
      strategy once the inner loop completes and we need them again becomes
      negligible.\x{\footnote{%
         With LRU or FIFO replacement, ...
   }}}, {
      no access will be to a cache line that is still loaded; once the inner loop
      completes, the cache line holding \alts[2]{\mintinline{c}{E[0][i]}, \(B_{0,i}\)}
      will have been evicted.%
      \footnote{%
         assuming LRU or FIFO replacement % XXX: but we use optimal replacement!
      }%
   },
}
Therefore, this algorithm incurs \(\Theta(mn)\) cache misses.

The algorithm is \alts{by definition, technically} already cache-oblivious since it
doesn't use \(M\) or \(B\), but it is not optimal\x{ in the \gls{com}}.  We can do better
with a divide-and-conquer approach.  The idea is to recursively divide the input matrix
\(D\) into two equal-sized submatrices along the greater dimension.  If \(m \geq n\) (more
rows than columns), let
\begin{equation*}
   D = \begin{bmatrix}
      D_1\\
      D_2
   \end{bmatrix}
\end{equation*}
and use \(D^\mathsf{T} = \begin{bmatrix} D_1^\mathsf{T} & D_2^\mathsf{T} \end{bmatrix}\)
to compute the transpose.  If \(m < n\), analogously \alts{slice, split} \(D\) vertically.
Eventually, the submatrices will become small enough so that pairs of input and output
submatrices fit into cache at the same time, at which point it doesn't matter in what
order we access the elements.\footnote{%
   No cache line will have to be evicted once loaded.
}
The recursion continues all the way down to \(1 \times 1\) submatrices, but this doesn't
change the theoretical analysis.  According to
\textcite[theorem 2 and 3, \ppno~19--21]{coa-thesis}
% \textcite[theorem 2 and 3, \ppno~19\psqq]{coa-thesis}
this algorithm incurs an optimal amount of \(\Theta(1 + mn / B)\) cache misses.
% This reduces the amount of cache misses to \(\Theta(1 + \nicefrac{mn}{B})\) according to
% \textcite[theorem 2, \ppno~19\psq]{coa-thesis}.
\Cref{lst:xpose} shows my implementation in C.

% FIXME: get rid of this `center` hack and get the vertical spacing around listings with

% In practice, the new algorithm performs as badly as one might expect from this excessive
% use of recursion.
In practice, the new algorithm performs worse than the straightforward one for a lot of
matrix sizes before it eventually pulls ahead.
\alts{
   {\Cref{fig:xpose-speedup} gives the speedups for square matrices of various sizes},
   {\Cref{fig:xpose-speedup} gives the speedup compared to the straightforward
   implementation\x{, which is usually faster}},
}.
The problem may be the excessive use of recursion.

Kumar works around this by \say{[stopping] the recursion when the problem size becomes
less than a certain block size and then [using] the simple for loop implementation inside
the block}~\cite[199--201]{afmh}.  This seems to \alts{compromise, jeopardize} the
\alts{cache-obliviousness, cache-oblivious nature} of the algorithm.
Perhaps cache-oblivious algorithms should be seen as a starting point for further
optimizations that \alts{explicitly use the available information about the memory
hierarchy of the machine a program runs on, take the properties of the target machine into
account}.

\x{
Another approach may be to
\alts{
   {slice the matrix so that the split dimension becomes an even power of \(2\) for one of
   the submatrices},
   {\alts{split, divide} the matrix so that one of the resulting submatrices has a size
   that is an even power of \(2\) along the dimension we split}
}.
\alts{
   {Once a square submatrix whose dimensions are an even power of \(2\) is obtained, the
   identical order of traversal that would result from the recursive algorithm can be
   reproduced with a single loop.},
   {Once a submatrix whose dimensions both are an even power of \(2\) is obtained, the
   identical order of traversal that would result from the recursive algorithm can be
   reproduced with loops relatively easily.},
