Some architectural properties of hardware caches lead to important concepts for using them
effectively.

% TODO: make this the first subsection?
\input{tex/basic-concepts/prefetching.tex}
% TODO: merge the next two section into one: "Locality of Reference"?  What about *data
% locality*?
\input{tex/basic-concepts/spatial-locality.tex}
\input{tex/basic-concepts/temporal-locality.tex}
% This can probably be merged with the locality sections.
\input{tex/basic-concepts/access-pattern.tex}
\input{tex/basic-concepts/associativity.tex}
% Associativity has to be explained before conflict misses.
\input{tex/basic-concepts/miss-types.tex}

% TODO: section about the structure of cache entries?  Tag, data block, and flag bits
% ("dirty" bit and "valid" bit).  See
