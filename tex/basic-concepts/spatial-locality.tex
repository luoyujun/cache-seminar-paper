\subsection{Spatial Locality}
Data is loaded from bigger, slower memory into smaller, faster memory (e.g. from main
memory into the CPU cache) in \emph{blocks}.

Moving down the memory hierarchy, access latencies increase faster than the
\emph{obtainable} bandwidth: \say{[w]e can still achieve large bandwidths by accessing
many close-by bits together [...].  Access to large \emph{blocks} [emphasis added] of
memory is almost as fast as access to a single bit},~\cite[2]{afmh}.

% TODO: move this.
% Consider the program shown in \cref{lst:array-sum}.  It repeatedly loops over an array
% to compute the sum of its elements.  Before exiting, it prints the CPU time spend
% summing the array.
