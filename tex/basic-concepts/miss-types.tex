\subsection{Types of Cache Misses}

% Three types of cache misses according to [1] and [2].
% * Compulsory misses
% * Capacity misses
% * Conflict misses
% Drepper uses the same classification (pp. 34, 55), but doesn't really introduce it.

% Wikipedia is confusing, though:
% > There are three kinds of cache misses: instruction read miss, data read miss, and data
% > write miss.
